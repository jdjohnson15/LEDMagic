# LEDMagic
This is a controller app for some Arduino-controlled LED towers hooked up to my PC.

Eventually I want to make it 
1. Work with a mobile app to change colors / patterns
2. Use a GUI to play with patterns
3. React to audio from the PC's sound card
4. React to graphics on the screen 
5. Get some IoT going with a ESP8266
